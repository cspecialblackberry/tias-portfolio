            <p>Project Overview</p>
            <p>This project aimed to enhance the user experience within the beauty and skincare space by creating custom icons and redesigning the Ulta Beauty app and website.
                Observing that many beauty apps, like Sephora or Ulta, lacked specific icons for products such as sunscreen and face cleansers, I identified an opportunity to improve 
                user accessibility and ease of navigation. I aimed to create icons that simplified product recognition while ensuring the interface remained visually appealing and intuitive 
                across devices.
            </p>
            <p>Design Concept</p>
            <p>I focused on designing icons that were both simple and highly recognizable. Inspired by my passion for beauty, I aimed to create intuitive icons that users could instantly 
                associate with specific product types, even for items that typically require text-heavy descriptions (e.g., face cleansers). This concept emphasizes clarity, reducing the 
                need for users to read detailed names to understand each productâ€™s purpose. The Ulta Beauty app and website redesign further illustrated how these icons could enhance 
                navigation, providing a cleaner and more accessible user experience.
            </p>
            <p>Technical Execution</p>
            <p>Using Adobe Illustrator, I crafted each icon with minimalistic yet distinctive details, ensuring that users could easily differentiate between product types. I used Adobe XD 
                to bring the icons into a real-life setting for the app and website redesign, adapting them for mobile and desktop layouts. This redesign also focused on accessibility improvements, 
                with user-friendly features designed to optimize navigation and visual hierarchy on both small and large screens. Through this project, I combined aesthetic functionality with 
                accessibility, resulting in a practical yet engaging interface for the beauty community.
